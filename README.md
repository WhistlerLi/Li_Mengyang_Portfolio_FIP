# Li_Mengyang_Portfolio_FIP

## The portfolio site you develop this term is ultimately what you will use to present your work and
your skillset (as designers and/or developers) to potential clients and employers. As such, the
design and presentation of that design is up to you entirely, within the technical parameters
listed below. Your final portfolio site will incorporate your logo and build upon the
interface/branding designs you develop in Electronic Image and Production.
